            <!-- <h3>Why/About us</h3> -->
            <br>
            <p>At GEKO we don’t believe travelling should be pricey. We want to open opportunities for all kinds of travellers, whether you are solo, a full time working professional, or a student. Giving people a bigger and better social platform to connect on. We aim to allow our members to swap their homes or rooms with each other, free of charge, and explore a new destination. GEKO will ensure your trip is safe and secure and will be there to assist whenever needed.  
            </p>

            <div class="p-4"><h3>Working from home</h3>
                <br>
                <p>We at GEKO believe travelling shouldn’t be on hold just because the world is, there is never a time like now! 
                    People are itching to travel as many of us have been locked up in our homes working remotely for nearly a year. Why not allow people to change their scenery and when they finish working in the evenings explore a new destination? We want to help people keep their motivation and ensure peoples mental health taken into factor when working from home. 
                    </p>
                </div>

    <div class="p-4"><h3>Trial</h3>
        <br>
        <p>We aim to trial GEKO on 15 individuals from LA, San Francisco, Austin, Chicago and New York City who are currently able to travel throughout the USA. We want to ensure any hiccups are sought out before launching the GEKO APP to the public.
